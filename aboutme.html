                <h2 class="aboutme__title">About Me</h2>
                <p>I am a mum to three children and carer to my youngest
                    daughter Ellie. Last year, after being out of the workplace for over ten years, I knew that I
                    needed to start doing something for myself again, outside my caring role. I had always worked
                    from a young age and missed both the interaction and independence that the working role brings.
                    My confidence had diminished during my time out of work and I really wasnâ€™t sure exactly what I
                    wanted to do.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Fast forward one year. I successfully completed a back to work course specifically for Family
                    Carers. The course provided support around the practicalities of going back to work but also
                    offered coaching and personal support around lack of confidence and concerns around returning to
                    work. I availed of both counselling which I had done before and coaching which was new to me.
                    The experience of coaching was life changing. For the first time in years I had a goal to work
                    on for me but also gained a realisation of /insight into how beneficial the years in my caring
                    role would be to me going forward and how all of the strengths and skills I had gained are
                    invaluable, lived experiences. I knew going forward that I possessed a true empathy for what
                    people are going through in their lives, especially those in a caring role.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Along with my caring role, I have been working as a part-time Project-Assistant since January
                    2022, on the same course that I completed myself. An opportunity that opened up for me to work
                    with two cohorts of amazing family carers, supporting and guiding them to the next chapter of
                    their journey, confirmed for me that coaching was the next chapter of my journey. I felt that
                    having both the lived experience of being a carer and also having been a previous participant on
                    the course I could support the groups with pure empathy and truly acknowledge their struggles.
                    So I have taken the steps to put a professional hat on all of my experiences in life both
                    personally and professionally to become a Life Coach. I am hoping that with some hard work (and
                    a bit of good luck) that I will be qualified to begin this journey in June 2023.

                <p>I will provide a safe space, for you the client,
                    to learn how to look inwards and explore areas in your life where you may be feeling lost or
                    stuck. While I will support you in this process you will decide on the goals you want to
                    achieve and the steps that you want to take to get there.</p>
                <br>
                <p>I am particularly passionate about supporting Family Carers and parents that have gone
                    through or are going through a diagnosis for their child/children. Having gone through this
                    myself, I know how frightening and overwhelming it feels to be handed a piece of paper with
                    a diagnosis on it for your child and then sent on your way with no idea of how to navigate
                    this new information or deal with the huge emotions that are unearthed. </p>
                <br>
                <p> I will provide
                    support and guidance around this very delicate time and offer supports and signposting on
                    the practical side of things going forward. Although every diagnosis is not the same, the
                    paths of which will cross along the way.
