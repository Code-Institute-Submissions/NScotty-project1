 * Landing Page
    * The landing page is an image of a person sitting on a hill in front of beautiful scneney and a winding path below. I really like this image as it can be perceived either as resting and admiring the end of a journey or contemplating the start of an exciting adventure. I wanted the image to be ignite users imaginations and inspire them that life coaching and self exploration can be an exciting, rewarding adventure as well as a challenge ans accomplishment.
    * The landing page also has zoom animation which further lends the page appeal to capture the users interest.
